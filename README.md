# Archimedes Maven Tiles

The purpose of this project is to provide several [Maven Tiles](https://github.com/repaint-io/maven-tiles). A "tile" is a preconfigured chunk of Maven configuration, so using a tile avoids you repeating over and over the same Maven configuration boilerplate.

You can use the tiles in this project direclty in your Maven `pom.xml` file as ready to "production", or simply as an example to inspire you to make your own tiles.
